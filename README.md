A clock animation visually represents the movement of a clock's hands over time, mimicking the passage of hours, minutes, and seconds. In a standard clock animation, the second hand moves in a continuous or ticking motion, followed by the minute and hour hands advancing proportionally. Digital clock animations often feature changing numbers to show time progression. These animations can be used to illustrate real-time clock functionality, show time elapsing rapidly, or even visualize alarms or countdowns. Often designed to be smooth and visually engaging, clock animations are popular in user interfaces, educational tools, and mobile applications.
